# Turtle Graphics (logo)

  This is an implementation of [Turtle Graphics][1] for the browser using 
  javascript and html5 canvas. It is an interactive version that lets 
  you control the turtle on the screen by using commands similar to the 
  [Logo programming language][2].

  It is still a work in progress but you can find a deployed version [here][3]
  and for more details head over to the [docs][4]. Feel free to log any [issues][5]
  or even [fork away][6]
